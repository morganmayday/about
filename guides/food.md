## Morgan Mayday's Guide to Fucking Eating Enough

Ley's Rules of Food are as follows. Eat enough, eat what makes you happy, eat healthy. They're in that order for a reason: tackle _eat enough_ before the other two. Caveat here of of course this does kinda rely on having the ability to acquire food but like. If you don't have that I cannot help you, I don't have the funds to provide mutual aid with any consistency at this time.

### 0: Prep
Get a sheet of paper or two and a pencil, or a word document open.

### 1: Identify
Make three bullet point lists. 

  1: What food can I, when it's cooked for me, almost always eat comfortably?
  
  2: What food can I cook, with a minimum of prep time and effort?
  
  3: What "snacks" can I eat mindlessly?

### 2: Plan
Take your lists. Crossreference 1 and 2: what shows up there? Plan for those meals--if it's pasta, get noodles next time you're out and about, for example. Pasta's actually a really good one, boxes are cheap and the ingredients are nonperishable--well, red sauce comes in cans if you like it and butter is easy-as to know when it's gonna go bad, at least.

Take your third list and see what requires least mess and processing. If it's potato chips, it's potato chips. I know some folk eat chips with chopsticks, that helps with mess. Get yourself--and if there are others in the house who consume it, _yourself specifically--_ a bag, box, container of whatever it is. Keep it at or by your desk or wherever you spend time with a bowl, plate, or something to pour it onto.

### 3: Schedule
Look at your usual day-to-day schedule. For example, I get out of bed around 0600, take a rest/stretch around 1300, and go to bed around 2200. Those are three natural divisions to build my food schedule around. 

Commit to _relative times._ For example, no matter when I get out of bed, be it 0600 or 1800, I'm going to eat about twenty minutes later, and it's going to be the piss-easiest meal I can make. I'm talking a fruit cup from the fridge. I'm talking leftovers still cold. I'm talking a bowl of dry cereal. I'm talking toaster waffles. Point is, I know I have no energy for fancy breakfasts, and I know the important thing is just getting something to happen.

> Tip: watching YouTube while you eat can be helpful. Something to pay attention to that isn't the texture or the experience that makes the time go faster can be _really nice._

You can schedule the mealtimes clock-different different days of the week, as long as they're _relatively_ the same--if your last class gets out at 1500 on Monday and 2000 on Tuesday, you can go "I'll eat after class" both times and it'll work. Don't beat yourself up about missing committed-to mealtimes, but when you notice you've missed one, just try to eat something small ASAP--don't wait for the next one.

### 4: Snack
Keep that mindless snack by your day-to-day setup. If you go out and do things, ziploc or tupperware a bit of it for your day. The point is, _graze a little._ If you pour yourself a bowl of chips or something while watching smth or doing smth, taking the effort to start eating generally means you'll be able to continue without even really noticing or using effort as much.

### 5: Enjoy
Finding a meal that you _enjoy_ the process of making isn't necessary to eating enough, but it is a very healing experience. If you don't know how to cook, try my grilled cheese recipe. Good starters tend to be simple recipes with very few ingredients or prep stages, with food you can eat the moment it's done, with very little cook time--for example, my grilled cheese takes about 5 minutes of setup, 7 minutes to cook, 1 minute to clean up, and can be eaten right off the pan if you don't mind burning your tongue a little.

> you can also do this with a pb&j btw ive been doing that ever since i ended the multidecade abusive relationship with cheese
> 
> Total cook time 15min
>
> 
> 3 cheeses--I use a slice of colby jack, a slice of cheddar, and a sprinkling of parmesan.
> 
> Butter--I use Imperial buttery spread, about a third of a stick for a full sandwich
> 
> Bread--this is for two slices, I use specifically Waterfront Sourdough. Good sourdough is best
> 
> Spices--to taste. I recommend a clove of garlic, fresh crushed, some parsley, some oregano, some lemon pepper, and some salt.
> 
> A source of heat or sweet, depending on taste--not necessary, but nice. Crushed red pepper is good. A tiny tiny bit of honey or mustard spread on the inside of the bread also fucks if you're into that.
>
> 
> A saucepan, a knife, a stove, and a spatula/tongs/flipping implement
>
> 
> 1: Stove on 3 (medium low heat), saucepan on stove. Cut the butter you're using into slices or chunks or whatever for faster melt, or don't I'm not your dad, then put in pan.
> 
> 2: While butter melting, array the bread and cheeses as desired on it. Close the sandwich when finished.
> 
> 3: Put spices in pan, swirl around with spatula for a minute or two in the butter. Usually I do this before butter's totally melted, makes total time lower.
> 
> 4: Remove garlic or any other chunky spices from pan.
> 
> 5: Dip the side of the sandwich that will be face up in the sauce, then close the sandwich again and put it other-side-down in pan.
> 
> 6: Up heat slightly (I do to 4), then set a four-minute timer. Leave to cook.
> 
> 7: Flip at 4 minutes, then set 3 minute timer.
> 
> 8: Serve hot and enjoy.
