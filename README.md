what do you need to know?

like, truly, what?

why are you here? what are you looking for? a list of triggers? a list of pronouns? a list of political positions?

you aren't gonna find that. not really, at least. i'm a very private thing. if you wanna get to know me, contact me. 

...but that won't satisfy, will it? in this age of self-as-performance, of constant availability, of therapy-speak and the terminal knowledge that wherever you go, they're watching, a thousand thousand cameras in a thousand thousand pockets, DNI's and carrds and and and.

i'm not going to give you any of that.

but, perhaps, i can tell you a story.
