in storytelling, there's a rule of threes. there's probably some academic reason for it. doesn't really matter.

you've met her. you've met me. he's sitting at the edge of the firelight, sprawled back, rocks and dirt on his palms, staring at the stars.

he's not much for chatter. he sees me mention him, sits up, gives you a wave, yawns, lies back. maybe he'll say something, later. not now, though. for now...
