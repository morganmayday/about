if you're taking it in the "we don't believe we deserve respect" way, then yeah, that's concerning, but. that's not what we mean.

there's a piece that evokes what we're talking about here better than i ever could.

being a person denotes this--this-- (It gestures animatedly, frustration on its face.) _thrall,_ this being beholden, to what exactly society defines a person as. being a person means it's not okay to do bad things to me--but it's still not okay, and _we're not people._ it's a political statement, a gauntlet thrown in the name of making _people_ (I've rarely seen her with such venom in a single word.) reconsider just what that _means._ 

(It catches its breath.)

if i am not a person, you cannot unperson me. that is a weapon that has no power over me.

(she nods.) We're not people. If you respect us, you have to square those two facts. If you don't respect us, you have to find a different weapon.
