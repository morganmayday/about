Gah. (she gestures, rubs her temple.) I'm not the poet. This isn't really my realm, there isn't a clean-cut definition for what it is to me.

It's wild surmise. It's a plot, a plan, a scheme that just might work. It's a connection you can't see til it tells you the story. How could I not love it? (she shrugs.) Without it, I'm aimless.
